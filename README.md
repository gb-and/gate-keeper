The program was written by me from scratch from similar closed program version which could not be installed on android 6. That's why the versioning takes into account the previous program and that's why the numbering of releases is so high, but there is a new version 0.6.9 - 6.9 in the program.

Please send your remarks to the program on e-mail: grzegorz.bylica@gmail.com.
